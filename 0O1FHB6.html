            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal website!
                I am Fikereab Habtamu Badege, a passionate researcher 
                currently pursuing an MSc in Inorganic Chemistry at Bahir 
                Dar University. My research focuses on the synthesis and 
                application of Mn-doped CuO/rGO composites for rechargeable 
                zinc-air batteries, a project dedicated to advancing 
                sustainable energy solutions.</p>
                <p>Beyond academics, I have extensive leadership experience, 
                having served as a member of the Student Union's Academic 
                Affairs team and as an executive of the Kha with Passion 
                charity club at Bahir Dar University. These roles have 
                allowed me to contribute to both academic excellence 
                and impactful community service. To enhance my technical 
                expertise, I received hands-on training in Gas 
                Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) through 
                a program facilitated by the Royal Society of 
                Chemistry. This experience has strengthened 
                my analytical skills, which are pivotal 
                in both my research and professional development.</p>
             <p>I am driven by a commitment to innovation, 
               knowledge-sharing, and creating a positive impact 
               through science and community engagement.</p>

            <h2>Current Project</h2>
            <p><b>Project Title:</b> Synthesis and Application of Manganese-Doped CuO/rGO Composites 
            for Rechargeable Zinc-Air Batteries—A Pathway to Sustainable Energy Solutions</p>
      <p><b>Project Overview</b></p>
     <p>This research project focuses on the development, characterization, and application 
     of manganese (Mn)-doped copper oxide (CuO) integrated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) 
     as an advanced electrode material for rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). 
     The primary goal is to enhance the performance, stability, and efficiency of zinc-air 
     batteries by leveraging the unique properties of these composite materials, ultimately 
     contributing to the advancement of sustainable and high-performance energy storage systems.</p>
      <p><b>Scientific and Technological Significance</b></p>
      <p>Rechargeable zinc-air batteries are considered one of the most promising next-generation 
      energy storage technologies due to their high theoretical energy density, environmental 
      friendliness, and cost-effectiveness. However, their widespread commercialization has 
      been hindered by challenges such as sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen 
      evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, poor cycle stability, and limited rechargeability. 
      Addressing these limitations requires the development of novel electrocatalytic 
      materials with superior catalytic activity, electrical conductivity, and long-term durability.</p>
      <p><b>Broader Impact</b></p>
     <p>This project not only advances fundamental material science but also has practical 
     implications for the commercialization of zinc-air batteries. The findings could lead 
     to the development of alternative catalysts to replace expensive noble metals like 
     platinum and iridium, thereby reducing costs and increasing the accessibility of 
     advanced energy storage systems.
     This expanded version provides a comprehensive understanding of your project’s 
     significance, methodology, and expected impact. Let me know if you'd like 
     further refinements!</p>
