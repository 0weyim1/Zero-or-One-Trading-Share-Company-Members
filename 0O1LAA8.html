            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal website!
                I am Lidet Awlachew Agonafr. I completed my undergraduate studies and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Biology.
                This provided me with a strong foundation in biological principles and their practical applications. 
                Currently, I am furthering my education by pursuing a Master of Science degree in Applied Microbiology at Bahir Dar University.  
                I was selected for the BDU talent program, which supports promising students in their graduate studies.  
                This program is enabling me to specialize in the study of microorganisms and their applications.

            <h2>Current Project</h2>
            <p><b>Project Title:</b>Effectiveness of Environmentally Friendly Mosquito Trap</b></p>
            <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
             <p>Mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue, and Zika virus, pose significant public health challenges worldwide. Traditional mosquito control methods, such as chemical insecticides, often have adverse environmental and health effects. 
             This project explores the effectiveness of an environmentally friendly mosquito trap as a sustainable alternative for mosquito control.</p>
             <p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>To evaluate the efficiency of an eco-friendly mosquito trap in reducing mosquito populations.</li>
        <li>To compare its effectiveness with conventional mosquito control methods.</li>
        <li>To assess the impact of the trap on non-target organisms and overall ecosystem health.</li>
        <li>To explore cost-effectiveness and feasibility for large-scale implementation.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
    <p>This study will involve the design and testing of an environmentally friendly mosquito trap that utilizes 
    natural attractants, such as carbon dioxide, heat, and organic bait. The project will include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Field trials in different environmental conditions to measure mosquito capture rates.</li>
        <li>Comparison with traditional insecticide-based control methods.</li>
        <li>Monitoring of biodiversity impact to ensure minimal disruption to beneficial insect populations.</li>
        <li>Data analysis to determine statistical significance of the trap's effectiveness.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p>
    <p>The findings from this project could contribute to sustainable mosquito control strategies with reduced environmental impact. An effective eco-friendly mosquito trap would provide an 
    alternative to chemical insecticides, promoting biodiversity conservation and human health protection.</p>

    <p><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Demonstration of the effectiveness of environmentally friendly mosquito traps in reducing mosquito populations.</li>
        <li>Identification of key factors influencing trap performance.</li>
        <li>Recommendations for large-scale deployment in mosquito-prone regions.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>By promoting environmentally sustainable mosquito control solutions, this research aims to provide a viable alternative to 
    chemical-based interventions, ultimately reducing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases while preserving ecological balance.</p>
