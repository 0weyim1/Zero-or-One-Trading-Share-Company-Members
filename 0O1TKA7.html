            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my personal website! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Addis Ababa Science 
                and Technology University, specializing in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. With a strong background 
                in applied mathematics, I have dedicated my research to understanding the dynamics of disease spread, epidemiological 
                modeling, and control strategies using mathematical frameworks.</p>
          <p>I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of South Africa, where my dissertation, 
            <em>Mathematical Model of HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Their Coevolution with Optimal Control: A Case Study in Ethiopia</em>, 
            focused on modeling the two epidemic diseases and their co-infection. My research explored possible control mechanisms such as 
            prevention, screening, and treatment, while effectively applying optimal control theory. My work contributes to public health 
            decision-making, outbreak predictions, and the optimization of disease control measures.</p>
        <p>Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring students in Mathematics for Natural and 
            Social Sciences, Applied Mathematics, Mathematical Modeling, Numerical Analysis, and Computational Simulations. 
            I have published five peer-reviewed articles in accredited journals, including <em>Results in Physics</em> (Elsevier), 
            <em>Journal of Biological Systems</em> (World Scientific), <em>Journal of Applied Mathematics</em> (Wiley), and 
            <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Additionally, I have presented my work at international conferences.</p>
            <p>I have been actively involved in interdisciplinary collaborations with epidemiologists, public health officials, and 
                policymakers to apply mathematical insights to real-world disease challenges. My current research interests include COVID-19 modeling, 
                vector-borne disease dynamics, and data-driven predictive models for emerging infections.</p>
         <p>In addition, I enjoy organizing workshops and training programs to promote the use of mathematics in solving global health challenges.</p>

            <p><b>Project Title:</b>Mathematical Modeling of the Spread and Control of Select Infectious Diseases: A Case Study in Ethiopia</b></p>
              <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>Infectious diseases remain a significant public health challenge in Ethiopia, affecting millions of people annually. 
       Mathematical modeling serves as a crucial tool for understanding the transmission dynamics of these diseases, 
       evaluating intervention strategies, and guiding public health policies. 
       This study focuses on constructing and analyzing mathematical models that describe the spread and control 
       of specific transferable diseases within the Ethiopian context.</p>
       <p><strong>Modeling Approaches</strong></p>
    <p>The research will incorporate various epidemiological models, including:</p>
        <li><strong>Deterministic models</strong> (e.g., SIR, SEIR, SEIRS, SIRS) to analyze disease dynamics in different population groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Stochastic models</strong> to account for the inherent randomness in disease transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimal control models</strong> to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination, treatment, and quarantine strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Network-based models</strong> to study disease spread across different regions or social structures in Ethiopia.</li>

    <p><strong>Target Diseases</strong></p>
    <p>The study will focus on infectious diseases of major concern in Ethiopia, such as:</p>
        <li>Malaria</li>
        <li>Tuberculosis (TB)</li>
        <li>HIV/AIDS</li>
        <li>COVID-19</li>
        <li>Cholera</li>
        <li>Other vector-borne or communicable diseases</li>

    <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
    <p>This study will address key epidemiological and public health concerns, including:</p>
        <li>What are the key factors influencing the transmission and persistence of selected diseases in Ethiopia?</li>
        <li>How do environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic variables affect disease spread?</li>
        <li>What are the most effective intervention strategies (e.g., vaccination, quarantine, vector control) to minimize disease burden?</li>
        <li>How do different modeling approaches compare in predicting real-world epidemiological patterns?</li>

    <p><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong></p>
    <p>The outcomes of this study will provide <strong>quantitative insights</strong> to policymakers, enabling 
       <strong>evidence-based decision-making</strong> for disease control. The findings can also contribute to 
       global efforts in infectious disease modeling by incorporating Ethiopia-specific parameters into mathematical frameworks.</p>
